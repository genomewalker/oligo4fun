{"name":"oligo4fun","tagline":"Pre-oligotyping diagnostics for functional genes","body":"### Background\r\n[**Oligotyping**](http://merenlab.org/projects/oligotyping/) [1] was originally developed to detect subtle differences in the 16S rRNA gene, which is a non-protein coding gene, conserved on the nucleotide level and under functional selection on all nucleotide positions. On the contrary, protein coding genes are conserved on the amino acid level and changes at the nucleotide level are often non-selective in the third codon due to the degenerated nature of the genetic code (silent substitutions). Changes on the first or second codon are likely to produce a change on the amino acidic sequence, and in some cases this change could result in an increase of fitness or adaptation. Using a high resolution entropy based method like [**oligotyping**](http://merenlab.org/projects/oligotyping/) or [**MED**](http://merenlab.org/projects/med/) [2] on coding sequences can result in the overestimation of the effective genetic diversity in the environment as a result of a much faster evolution rate of the third position in the codon. \r\n\r\nIn Zure et al. 2016 [3] we developed a set of diagnostics to explore the existence of substitution saturation on the alignments of functional genes that will be used for oligotyping.\r\n\r\n### Tutorial\r\nA detailed tutorial on how to use **oligo4fun** can be found [**here**](genomewalker.github.io/oligo4fun/tutorial/oligo4fun.html)\r\n### References\r\n[1] Eren, A.
